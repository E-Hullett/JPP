//Explanation
    //The goal of this app is to create a server and a react app within the same project, make use of a postgres SQL database, deploy it on heroku
    //There will be a main package.json file and a package.json file for react.
    //The client folder will hold all react files, the server folder will hold all express-related files

//Setup file system
    //Create parent directory
    //Create server child directory  (the client sub-direcotry is created by create-react app)

//Seting up the server
    npm init
    npm install body-parser cookie-parser express pg request request-promise --save
    npm install concurrently nodemon --save-dev
    //setup express server within the server folder
//Setting up client
    cd [parent directory]
    npx create-react-app client
    cd client
    npm install reactstrap
    //Make sure that all npm installs for the react front-end are in the client folder, so that the react package-json gets them

    //setup react frontend
//Installing npm modules


//Initial git setup
    //Created online git repo
    //Added node to .gitignore

    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Ethan1745/weather_app
    echo node_modules > .gitignore
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git push origin master -f

npm install body-parser --save
npm install express
npm install pg

//Run server
node src/server/index.js
//add above command to scripts, hence can be run as: npm run server

//Combine react script and express server
npm install concurrently --save
//package.json, "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run start\""
npm run dev


//Use pgAdmin to create local database
//Fill that local db using SQL queries (with the Query Tool)

//Deploy to heroku
Use heroku_commands.txt

//Add postgres to path
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\10\bin






//Setting up multiple pages
    cd client
    npm install react-router
    //add routes.js


//Copy this project
